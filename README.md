# Vacation Rentals

This was an exercise in duplicating the mobile and desktop versions of a vacation rental sites's landing page using HTML and CSS, and in the use of forms and input fields.  It doesn't "do" anything.  
* Desired layouts and image sizes were achieved using flexbox.
* This page is responsive to differing screen witdths and was designed with a  mobile-first development approach.  A media query in the CSS stylesheet applies modified formatting to screens wider than 768px.
* Clicking navigation links takes the user to corresponding sections within the same page.

* Here it is, running on [GitHub Pages](https://craig-r-kelly.github.io/Vacation-Rentals/).
