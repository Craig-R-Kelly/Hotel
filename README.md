# Vacation Rentals

This was an exercise in duplicating the mobile and desktop versions of a vacation rental sites's landing page using HTML and CSS.  It doesn't "do" anything.  
* Various forms and input fields appear, according to specifications.
* Desired layouts and image sizes were achieved using flexbox.
* This page is responsive to differing screen witdths and was designed with a  mobile-first development approach.  A media query in the CSS stylesheet applies modified formatting to screens wider than 768px.
* Clicking navigation links takes the user to corresponding sections within the same page.
